"""Parse generic response JSON files.

This adapter supports a class of JSON files where a top level `responses`
object contains one or more response items.  Each response item has a
`variations` mapping from seed names to lists of variations (strings).
Additional metadata such as `hotkey` and `uid` may be present to
identify the miner.  A quality score may be encoded elsewhere but is
treated as optional.

Example input structure (simplified):

```json
{
  "seed_names": ["Michael", "Ahmed", ...],
  "responses": {
    "149": {
      "uid": 149,
      "hotkey": "0xabc123",
      "variations": {
        "michael": ["micheal", "mikel"],
        "ahmed":   ["ahmad", "amed"]
      }
    },
    "150": {
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

The adapter yields one canonical record for each `(seed, variation)` pair.
The `miner_ext_id` is taken from the `hotkey` field if present; if not,
`uid` is used as a fallback.  No score is emitted because the example
files do not provide perâ€‘variation scores.
